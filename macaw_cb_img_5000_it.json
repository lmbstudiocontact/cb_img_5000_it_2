    "They typically live at elevations of 600 to 2600 m, higher in the mountains than most macaws ever range.",
    "Of those, there are critically endangered species present such as the ornate hawk-eagle, keel-billed motmot, and the scarlet macaw.",
    "Some of the country's most notable avian species include the resplendent quetzal, scarlet macaw, three-wattled bellbird, bare-necked umbrellabird, and the keel-billed toucan.",
    "The greatest problems threatening the macaw population are the rapid rate of deforestation and the illegal trapping for the bird trade.",
    "Furthermore, only the oldest residents of the region had knowledge of the macaw, with the species last recorded in the 1870s.",
    "This macaw is rare with a highly restricted range.",
    "Along the walls were glass cages holding live cockatoos, macaws, seagulls, pigeons, and parrots.",
    "However, these macaws may seasonally fly down to lowlands, where they are likely in humid forests and thorny woodlands."
