    "Their results support the experimental observations regarding spikes, high-shear layer and hairpin vortices.",
    "The induced momentum is not uniform, because back induction varies as hairpins grow, and since the growth angle is small, the momentum is slowly varying.",
    "However, the data are sufficient to reveal the patterns of entire hairpin packets and to use the vorticity field for qualitative flow visualization.",
    "Beyond the existence of hairpin vortices, the data also show individual hairpins commonly aligned behind each other in the x-direction to form a group.",
    "The spawned hairpins grew and spawned further hairpins in like fashion.",
    "The content of conserved hydrophobic residues in this hairpin is unusually high, and this suggests that the hairpin may interact with a hydrophobic partner.",
    "The transverse phase variation is responsible for the formation of hairpin vortices.",
    "The full range of hairpin and hairpin packet interactions can only be speculated."
