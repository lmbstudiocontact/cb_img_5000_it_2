    "They had the power to force landlords to pay for improvements on their estates over which they had little or no control.",
    "After 1862 landlords could contract labourers without going through the rural magistrate, but the decision could be costly.",
    "Fixed investment such as in liming or buildings was usually financed by landlords, although tenants had to provide the labour.",
    "Poorer tenants are likely to live in the properties in the worst condition and their landlords are more likely to have an 'investment motive'."
