    "The study was conducted on two groups of learners: 53 college students and 56 high school students.",
    "On each trial, the correctness and latency of the learner's verbal response were assessed.",
    "Another teaching approach used was text reconstruction, which, perhaps surprisingly, benefited the least educated learners the most.",
    "Table 2 gives the average performance of the foreign learners in both word categorization tasks.",
    "They conclude that self-management strategies contribute to an increase in learners' self- and contextual knowledge which can assist in reducing anxiety.",

    "The studies reviewed in this chapter point to a consistent minority of language learners who find language learning an uncomfortable and unsettling experience.",
    "This is a useful paper for those interested in researching the strategies that young learners employ."
