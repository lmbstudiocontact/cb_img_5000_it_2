    "These improvements in the outcome of pregnancy, nonetheless, concomitantly increase the genetic risk in the surviving population.",
    "On the other hand, there is a substantial amount of phenotypic covariance, and genetic and shared environmental influences contribute substantially to this overlap.",
    "Thus, although there would be third-party collaboration, it would not involve the difficulties typically associated with third-party genetic parentage. 40.",
    "Again, in this application the theory simplifies because of lack of a paternal genetic effect on the fruits (tomatoes are almost purely maternal tissue)."
