    "Meanwhile, the town's new gas lamps had ceased to operate by midyear.",
    "The reference light and a third beam used for accessory adaptation came from two other tungsten-halide lamps.",
    "I began to question my assumption - the basis of years of selfexperimentation - that light from the lamps caused early l awakening.",
    "The aluminium scaffolding had been previously covered by a black cotton cloth to reduce stray light from the various lamps.",
    "From the camera images, we extract horizontal lines and circular features that correspond to the lamps placed in the ceiling.",
    "Second, the intensity of the tungsten halogen lamps could be reduced in order to lower the thermal heating of plant canopies.",
    "The lamps have a variable angle, aperture and extent, so the beam of influence can be directed very precisely within the interpolation space (figure 1).",
    "Thus, all plants were measured under the seven lamps with their canopies aligned to face in the same direction."
