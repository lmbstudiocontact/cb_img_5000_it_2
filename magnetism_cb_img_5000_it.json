    "An inductive coupler is, in general, a small coil which amplifies the stray magnetism in the telephone; that is, in the hearing piece.",
    "When this aspect was felt to be too weak a reason for an expedition, the collection of scientific data was added, including meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, physical oceanography, and zoology.",
    "Aepinus formulated a corresponding theory of magnetism excepting that, in the case of magnetic phenomena, the fluids only acted on the particles of iron.",
    "He said that the whole of disease could be cured by magnetism.",
    "In this sense the study of terrestrial magnetism, and its extension as an observational field science, suffers from a similar aesthetic: invisible, intangible, difficult to grasp.",
    "In this system, reproduction was guaranteed by the magnetism of an extreme biological dimorphism: the greater the difference, the greater the love that binds and the more prolific the breeding.",
    "The work of heat transport is traditionally driven by mechanical work, but can also be driven by heat, magnetism, electricity, laser, or other means.",
    "Following the return of the expeditions, data were exchanged and synoptic charts plotted for meteorology and magnetism."
