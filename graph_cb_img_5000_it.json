    "The colour classes corresponding to chromatic number are the colour classes determined by complete graphs.",
    "Here we will need a slight extension of that result, assuming that only two out of the three bipartite graphs are -regular.",
    "The following strengthening is a powerful general tool for embedding bounded degree graphs (and often trees, too).",
